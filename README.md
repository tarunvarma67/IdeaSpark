# IdeaSpark
IdeaSpark is a Python Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to help you brainstorm and generate structured ideas for any concept. It acts as your personal AI strategist, breaking down vague concepts into actionable angles like target users, business models, technologies, and ethical considerations.
